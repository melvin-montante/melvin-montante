- 👋 Hi, I'm Melvin, a Mechanical Engineer with 6 years of experience in the industry and over 3 years of online tutoring in mathematics and mechanical engineering subjects.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data analytics, machine learning, and mobile app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Python, SQL, machine learning, and data analytics through DataCamp and building my portfolio on Kaggle and GitHub. In my current role, I'm using Python and SQL as tools in creating equipment maintenance database, creating programs to automate databasing and data entry, and analyzing KPIs such as efficiency, hold and spoilages of the plant I work for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data analytics and machine learning.
